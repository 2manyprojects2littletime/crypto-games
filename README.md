A toy project to cement some ideas about crypto and cryptanalysis leading up to a talk at PEI Devs.  Might eventually include examples for:
[ ] - frequency analysis of a given text or corpus
[ ] - cryptogram solver (monoalphabetic ciphers)
[ ] - Vignere cipher analysis (polyalphabetic cipher analysis)
[ ] - prime factoring (RSA)
[ ] - discrete logarithm (Diffie-Hellman)
[ ] - elliptic curve
